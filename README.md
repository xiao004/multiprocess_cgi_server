# multiprocess_cgi_server
This is a multi-process CGI service, a semi-synchronous and semi-asynchronous model used by the process pool. In the parent process, the listener socket is registered with epoll, and in the child process, the connection socket is registered with epoll. When the parent process listens for a new connection, it uses the rotation method to select a child process and notifies it by pipeline that there is a new connection. The notified child process accepts the connection from the listener socket and registers the acquired connection socket into the epoll of the child process.
